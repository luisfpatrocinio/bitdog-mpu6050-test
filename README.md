# bitdog-mpu6050-test

A simple project to test and visualize MPU6050 sensor readings using a Raspberry Pi Pico. The project reads roll and pitch angles from the MPU6050 accelerometer and uses them to control LED brightness in real-time.

## Features

- Real-time reading of MPU6050 accelerometer data
- Calculation of roll and pitch angles
- Visual feedback using RGB LEDs
- High update rate (15.6Hz) for smooth readings
- Modular code structure for easy maintenance and reuse

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:
- [bitdog-patroLibs](https://github.com/luisfpatrocinio/bitdog-patroLibs.git) - A collection of modular and reusable C libraries for Raspberry Pi Pico projects
  - Provides LED control functionality (`led.h` and `led.c`)

## Project Structure

- `main.c`: Main program logic and initialization
- `gyro.h`: MPU6050 sensor interface declarations
- `gyro.c`: MPU6050 sensor implementation
- LED control is provided by bitdog-patroLibs

## Building the Project

This project uses CMake with FetchContent to manage dependencies. The main dependencies are automatically downloaded during the build process.

```cmake
include(FetchContent)

FetchContent_Declare(
  bitdoglibs
  GIT_REPOSITORY https://github.com/luisfpatrocinio/bitdog-patroLibs.git
  GIT_TAG main
)

FetchContent_MakeAvailable(bitdoglibs)

target_link_libraries(your_project
  PRIVATE
    bitdog::patrolibs
)
```

## Hardware Requirements

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- MPU6050 sensor
- RGB LEDs
- I2C connections (SDA: GPIO2, SCL: GPIO3)

## Pin Configuration

- MPU6050:
  - SDA: GPIO2
  - SCL: GPIO3
- LEDs:
  - Red LED: Shows roll angle
  - Green LED: Shows pitch angle

## Usage

1. Connect the hardware according to the pin configuration
2. Flash the code to your Raspberry Pi Pico
3. The program will start reading sensor data and updating LED brightness based on the inclination angles
